At the top of the application, there are tabs that the user may access. Each one leads to different visualizations that show charts of the EIA data.

There's three different tabs: "Summary of US Data", "State, Energy, and Year Comparison", and the "About" tabs.
- Summary of US data
  - This submenu allows the user to view charts that show a summary of the data from all of the US. There's 3 different types of visualizations that the user is able to select from a dropdown menu: Bar Charts, Line Charts, and Raw Data Table
- Bar Charts
  - This tab is the starting page. It shows two different bar charts. The top one shows the total amount of each energy source produced per year. The bottom one shows the percent of total production for each energy source produced per year.
- Line Charts
  -   Selecting this tab from the dropdown lets the user view line charts. Just like the bar charts, the top chart shows the total amount of each energy source produced per year. The bottom chart shows the percent of total production for each energy source produced per year.
  - The user is able to select which energy source to view on the line chart. On the left of the screen, there is a checkmark box. Unchecking the "All" option will remove all lines currently on the plot, and then the user is able to freely choose which lines to plot by checking the corresponding energy source.
- Raw Data Table
  - This page shows a data table which contains the raw numbers from the dataset. The user is able to choose the order of viewing the data by clicking at the top of the column. Examples include showing from 2019 to 1990, or showing the highest to lowest amount of energy generated.
- State, Energy, and Year Comparison
  - Here, the screen is split into two regions. Each region corresponds to a set of dropdown choices, which allows the user to compare the two regions. Region 1 is on the left side and region 2 is on the right side. By default, the visualizations will show the data from all the energy sources and all the years in the data set. 
  - Hover over the dropdowns and you'll be able to choose which energy source to view, or which year to view data. You are also able to choose the state (or even the whole US which is the default selection in the second region to the right) from where the data originates. For example, a user could choose to see the amount of coal generated in Illinois in 1999 and either compare it with coal generated in 2009, or even a different energy source in 1999.
- About
  - This tab just displays information about the data, as well as who wrote the code.
